# Demand Retail Forecast for Small Enterprises (SSEs)

This repository hosts the implementation of a **Retail Demand Forecasting System** tailored for small enterprises. The solution leverages advanced machine learning techniques to model and predict demand patterns, enabling businesses to make informed decisions, reduce overstocking, and optimize inventory management.

---

## Key Features

### 1. Demand Forecasting with Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT)
Developed and implemented a state-of-the-art **Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT)** to forecast demand patterns from complex, multi-source datasets. The TFT model was chosen for its ability to capture temporal dependencies and interpretability in multi-horizon forecasting tasks.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Performed comprehensive **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on large-scale retail datasets:
- Uncovered key insights into demand trends and seasonality.
- Identified features critical to improving forecasting accuracy.
- Informed the feature engineering process and model selection to align with business needs.

### 3. Business Objective Alignment
Aligned forecast outputs with the business objectives of small enterprises:
- Mitigated overstocking issues by accurately predicting demand.
- Enhanced order placement through actionable, data-driven strategies.
- Delivered insights that directly improved operational efficiency.

### 4. Cross-Functional Collaboration and Integration
- Spearheaded **cross-functional collaboration** to ensure seamless integration of the forecasting model into existing workflows.
- Continuously optimized the system for **accuracy and scalability**, ensuring it evolves with the business’s growing needs.

## Benefits for Small Enterprises
- **Accurate Demand Predictions**: Improve inventory management and reduce overstocking.
- **Actionable Insights**: Drive data-driven decision-making for order placement and stock management.
- **Scalable Solution**: Designed to grow with the business while maintaining accuracy and efficiency.
